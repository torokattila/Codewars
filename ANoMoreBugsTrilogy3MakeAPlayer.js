myPlayer = new Player("Dumbo", "Kata Coder", 1,2,3,4);

myPlayer.name => "Dumbo"
myPlayer.position => "Kata Coder"
myPlayer.age => 1
myPlayer.dribbling => 2
myPlayer.pass => 3
myPlayer.shoot => 4
*/

function Player(name, position, age, dribbling, pass, shoot) {
  this.name = name;
  this.position = position;
  this.age = age;
  this.dribbling = dribbling;
  this.pass = pass;
  this.shoot = shoot;
}

const myPlayer = new Player('Dumbo', 'Kata Coder', 1, 2, 3, 4);

console.log(myPlayer.name);
console.log(myPlayer.position);
console.log(myPlayer.age);
console.log(myPlayer.dribbling);
console.log(myPlayer.pass);
console.log(myPlayer.shoot);
