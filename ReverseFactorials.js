/*I'm sure you're familiar with factorials â€“ that is, the product of an integer and all the integers below it.

For example, 5! = 120, as 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120

Your challenge is to create a function that takes any number and returns the number that it is a factorial of. So, 
if your function receives 120, it should return "5!" (as a string).

Of course, not every number is a factorial of another. In this case, your function would return "None" (as a string).

Examples
120 will return "5!"
24 will return "4!"
150 will return "None"*/

function reverseFactorial(num) {
    if (num === 1) return "1!";
	let reverse = num;

    for (let i = 2; reverse != i; i++) {
        reverse /= i;

        if (reverse === 0) {
            break;
        }
    }

    return reverse === 0 ? "None" : `${reverse}!`;
}

console.log(reverseFactorial(1));
