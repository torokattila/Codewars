/*James is a DJ at a local radio station. As it's getting to the top of the hour, he needs to find a 
song to play that will be short enough to fit in before the news block. He's got a database of 
songs that he'd like you to help him filter in order to do that.

What To Do
Create longestPossible(longest_possible in python and ruby) helper function that takes 1 integer 
argument which is a maximum length of a song in seconds.

songs is an array of objects which are formatted as follows:

{artist: 'Artist', title: 'Title String', playback: '04:30'}
You can expect playback value to be formatted exactly like above.

Output should be a title of the longest song from the database that matches the criteria of not 
being longer than specified time. If there's no songs matching criteria in the database, return false.*/

const songs = [
    { artist: 'Marillion', title: 'Keyleigh', playback: '03:36' },
    { artist: 'Pink Floyd', title: 'Time', playback: '06:48' },
    { artist: 'Rush', title: 'YYZ', playback: '04:27' },
    { artist: 'Bonobo', title: 'Days To Come', playback: '03:50' },
    { artist: 'Coldplay', title: 'Yellow', playback: '04:32' },
    { artist: 'Bloc Party', title: 'Like Eating Glass', playback: '04:22' },
    { artist: 'The Killers', title: 'For Reasons Unknown', playback: '03:30' },
    { artist: 'Arctic Monkeys', title: 'Teddy Picker', playback: '03:25' },
    {
        artist: 'Joe Satriani',
        title: 'Surfing With The Alien',
        playback: '04:34',
    },
];

function longestPossible(playback) {
    const possibilities = [];

    songs.forEach((song) => {
        const playbackTime =
            Number(song.playback.split(':')[0]) * 60 +
            Number(song.playback.split(':')[1]);

        if (playbackTime <= playback) {
            possibilities.push({
                title: song.title,
                length: playbackTime,
            });
        }
    });

    if (possibilities.length === 0) return false;

    const sortedPossibilities = possibilities.sort(
        (a, b) => b.length - a.length
    );

    return sortedPossibilities[0].title;
}

console.log(longestPossible(270));
